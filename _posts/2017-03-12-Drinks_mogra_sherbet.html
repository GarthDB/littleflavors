description : So my jasmine plants bloomed abundantly this summer, giving just the perfect quantity to prepare a fragrant, revitalizing juice made out of their flowers. It tastes as good as it smells! Sharing my recipe here:)
ingredients : Sugar- 2 kg,Water- 2 ltrs,Mogra- 1/2 kg
method: Clean the mogra flowers by removing the calyx of the mogra. Wash the flowers and strain. In a thick bottom vessel add sugar and water and boil for half an hour. Make sure you constantly stir in between. Once the chasni is thick, add the mogra and switch off the flame (it doesn't need to boil). Cover it immediately and leave it overnight. Strain and fill it up in glass bottles and you're good to go! Store it in the fridge. <br> To serve, mix with cold water and crushed ice.
