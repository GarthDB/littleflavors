description : This is my lovely mom's recipe . This was the very first sweet I learnt to make from my mom and it never fails. My kids gobble it up as soon as they get their hands on it!:D
ingredients : Cashew (full or pieces)- 1 cup,Sugar- 3/4th cup,Milk- 3/4th cup,Silver leaves - 1 packet (optional),Ghee- 1/2 tbsp
method: In a thick bottomed pan (kadai), put sugar and milk. On medium flame, let the sugar and milk cook till the sugar melts. Then lower the flame and cook till it thickens (to the consistency of 1 tar chashni). It will start to look milky. <br> Meanwhile, grind the cashews in the mixie till powdered. Be careful to avoid overgrinding as the cashew becomes sticky. Also apply ghee on a clean platform and the rolling pin (belan). Once the sugar syrup is ready, add the powdered cashews and mix well. Switch off the flame and pour it over the prepared area on the platform. Let it cool for half a minute and then spread it with the rolling pin as per desired thickness. I like to roll it thin. Let it cool. Then put the leaves over the barfi and cut into diamond shapes.
