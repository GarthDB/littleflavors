description : This is another take on the Kaju Barfi I made last time. All I did was switch up the cashews with peanuts. You can use the same ingredients and method to make barfi out of other nuts such as pista and badam well.
ingredients : Peanuts- 1 cup,Sugar- 3/4th cup,Milk- 3/4th cup,Ghee- 1/2 tbsp
method: In a thick bottomed pan (kadai), put sugar and milk. On medium flame, let the sugar and milk cook till the sugar melts. Then lower the flame and cook till it thickens (to the consistency of 1 tar chashni). It will start to look milky.<br> Meanwhile, grind the peanuts in the mixie till powdered. Also apply ghee on a clean platform and the rolling pin (belan). Once the sugar syrup is ready, add the powdered peanuts and mix well. Switch off the flame and pour it into a plate. Let it cool and cut into diamond shapes.
