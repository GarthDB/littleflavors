description : Jalebi is a popular Indian dessert made with maida and sugar syrup. Served during festivals and special occasions, this dessert recipe is loved not just by kids but adults too. For a twist, this simple recipe can also be served as a breakfast with milk or curd. Try this delicious recipe.
ingredients : Maida- 4tbsp, Udad dal atta- 1 tsp, Ghee- 1 tsp (melted), Curd- 2 tsp, Water , Saffron or orange food coloring - Less than a pinch if you are using food coloring
method :  Mix the maida, udad dal atta, and curd to form a thick batter. Keep it aside for 24-30 hrs to ferment.The batter loses its thick consistency once it ferments, hence make sure that when you make the batter it is pretty thick. After it ferments, add the saffron or food coloring and ghee and mix. Now the batter is ready for frying the jalebis. <br> For the sugar syrup ( It is advisable that you make this before you start preparing to fry the Jalebis as this sugar syrup (chasni) needs to be warm - not hot, when you dunk the jalebis in this) <br> What you'll need- <br> Sugar- 4 cups , Saffron- 1/4 tsp, Cardamom powder- 1 tsp <br> Method- In a thick saucepan put sugar and enough water to cover the sugar fully.Cook the syrup till it forms a 1 tar chasni. Add the saffron paste and elaichi. Mix well. Keep it aside. <br> For frying  <br> What you'll need- <br> Ghee- 3 cups, Flat pan- Small size , Plastic funnel or a bottle with a hole ( The bigger the hole, the thicker the Jalebis. I used a funnel, hence the size) <br> If you use bigger pan u will have to use more ghee for frying. <br> Method- Heat the ghee in the pan. Hold the funnel with the batter as shown in the picture and form jalebis in the pan. Once fried on one, side turn and fry again.Make sure the chasni warm. Take it out and put it in the warm sugar syrup. Let it soak till you fry the next lot.Then remove and put it in a steel strainer to drain out the excess syrup.Serve hot!!
